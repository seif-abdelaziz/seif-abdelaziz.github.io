            <p>As a kid, I had always dreamt of making my mobile app and
            publishing it to Android and iOS for people from around the world to
            download. Gladly, I was able to finally achieve this dream during
            the COVID lockdown.</p>

            <p>Right after the school had shut down I came up with an idea of a
            mobile app that informs you about the latest coronavirus cases in
            your area and around the world. Since online school was much less
            demanding than in-person school, I was able to develop this app in
            around 2 weeks. I didn’t have any prior experience with mobile app
            development so I decided on using Unity, a game engine that allows
            you to build apps to almost any platform. Although it was
            challenging and mediocre to build an app in a game engine, I managed
            to do it nonetheless.</p>

            <p>I was satisfied with the result and decided to submit it to the
            Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The submission process
            was quite annoying and repetitive. I had to take dozens of
            screenshots with multiple different devices and screen sizes. Once I
            submitted the app I waited patiently until I got my response back.
            Before submitting the app I had looked at the guidelines and rules
            for submitting apps and my app seemed to comply with all of them. I
            was not worried about my app getting declined since it followed all
            the guidelines, and I could just resubmit another version if there
            was a major problem</p>

            <p>A day after I had submitted the application, I got a response
            from Apple. They had rejected and suspended my app. A couple of days
            later I got a similar response from Google. They too rejected the
            app. To my surprise, both companies have been rejecting all
            coronavirus related applications due to the possibility of
            misinformation. I was quite devastated and disappointed after I
            found out about this. I had spent countless hours developing the app
            and was not able to publish it. After this setback, I decided to
            take a bit of a break from app development. </p>

            <p>A few weeks later, I was informed about an online hackathon
            happening in June. I decided to participate in it. I wanted to build
            another mobile app but wanted to make it in a more conventional way.
            I decided to take a short course on Flutter, a relatively new
            framework by Google which allows you to build apps for iOS and
            Android in one language. </p>

            <p>When I entered the hackathon I had little experience working with
            Flutter so I had to wing the hackathon. For the hackathon, I decided
            to create a mobile app that summarizes the privacy policies of
            popular websites and services such as Facebook and Zoom. I managed
            to finish the app in under 48 hours and was happy with the end
            result. After participating in another hackathon I had managed to
            quickly learn Flutter and was ready to build and publish a real
            app.</p>

            <p>In the past, I had developed chatbots on a chatting platform
            called Discord and could not find any application on the app store
            that had chatbots for Discord. As a result, I decided to make an app
            that is sort of like a marketplace/store for Discord bots.
            Developing the app was tough and time-consuming since I had to build
            a backend and a frontend. I used the APIs of existing bot lists on
            the web to populate the app with bots otherwise it would be empty
            and no one would use it. I was able to finish the app in one week
            and submitted it during summer vacation. This time, the submission
            process was worse than the one before. I encountered dozens of
            random errors while I tried to submit the app and had to completely
            reset my Macbook since it would not submit the app. After another
            week, I was able to finally submit the application. I had made sure
            that the app complied with all guidelines in fear of it being
            rejected or suspended.
            </p>
            
            <p>After patiently waiting for a couple of days it was added to the
            iOS and Android app stores on August 9th. I had finally achieved my
            dream of having my own app published on mobile. I didn’t expect the
            app to gain lots of traction since I didn’t have many means of
            marketing it or sharing it. I was hoping for the app to get at least
            a couple hundred downloads and that's it, but my mind was blown
            away. In the first few days, the app had gained 1,000 downloads
            already and had started to blow up. Then a month later the app had
            amassed over 10,000 downloads and almost 500 downloads per day. I
            was blown away by this growth and had never expected it to grow this
            much. Today, the app has now over 100,000 downloads with 3,000 new
            downloads every day and 5,000 daily active users.</p>

            <p>Developing this has been an amazing experience and I’ve learned a
            lot about mobile development. It's been a great experience waking up
            every day and reading all the reviews from nice people about how the
            app has made their lives much easier and how helpful it is. It truly
            makes me feel better knowing that this app helps thousands of people
            every day.
