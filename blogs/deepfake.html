            <h1>Deepfake's Threat to Internet Credibility</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>June 28th, 2020 · 2 minute read </h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Due to the rapid advancement in technology and artificial intelligence, we are reaching a point where
                nothing on the internet is believable.
                <br>
                <br>
                We’ve already seen this happen with articles and news stories on the internet and on TV. However, a new
                technology called deepfakes might make video evidence no longer credible. According to dictionary.com,
                deepfakes are “videos in which the face and/or voice of a person, usually a public figure, has been
                manipulated using artificial intelligence software in a way that makes the altered video look
                authentic.” Recently, deepfakes have been used to mislead the public. People have started deepfaking
                many politicians and celebrities, and some of them seem very real.
                <br>
                <br>
                Deepfakes are made using machine learning and artificial intelligence. They started to emerge in
                the 1990s where researchers were experimenting with the technology. However, this has changed over the
                past few decades. Today, amateurs and developers around the internet have started to create their own
                deepfakes. Deepfakes have also been used by proffesionals in movies to insert faces into existing
                movies. They've also been used in art and other industries as well
                <br>
                <br>
                So why are Deepfakes so dangerous? Deepfakes pose a large threat to politics and democracy. They can be
                used
                maliciously to make a politician say something false or controversial that they’ve never said before.
                And with the technology growing ever so quickly, it's starting to become difficult for the human brain
                to differentiate between a deepfake and a real video.
                <br>
                <br>
                To combat this inevitable issue, researchers have started creating software that detects deepfakes using
                the algorithms that deepfakes use themselves. To add on, lots of internet companies such as Reddit,
                Twitter and Google have agreed to ban deepfakes from their sites.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although deepfakes can have a positive impact on multiple industries, they can also pose a large threat
                to the credibility of the internet. We'll have to see for ourselves whether the good outways the bad.
