            <h1>Things I hate about Windows 10</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>January 16th, 2021 · 3 minute read </h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Although Windows 10 is Windows’ most popular operating system and
            the most popular operating system in the world, it still has some
            major design flaws and issues that haven’t been fixed ever since its
            release in 2015.</p>

            <h3>1. Non-Consistent UI</h3>

            <p>With the release of Windows 10, the UI received a massive
            overhaul. Although some parts of the UI were similar to Windows 8,
            it was almost non-identical to Windows 7. In Windows 10, Microsoft
            had favored a simpler and minimalistic design and eventually
            introduced their design system in 2017 called “Microsoft Fluent
            Design System”. This new design system was very promising since it
            promised to create an intuitive and responsive UI experience while
            also maintaining a uniform cross-platform experience. However,
            almost 4 years later and only a handful of Microsoft apps have
            adapted this new design.</p>

            <p>An example of this is the Calculator app which introduces blur, and unique hover effects.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_calculator.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Calculator</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>I am a big fan of this new design system, and I think other
            people like it as well. Sadly though, this design system is only
            adopted by a few apps. The majority of apps either adopt a lifeless
            design while still fitting in with Windows 10, or they look more
            like an application taken out straight from Windows XP or Windows 7.
            An example of this is the Math Input Panel application which adopts
            the same menu bar as Windows 7.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_math_input_panel.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Math Input Panel</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Another example similar to this is the difference between the
            Windows 10 settings application which adopts Microsoft’s Fluent
            Design System, and the Windows Control Panel (same as Settings
            application but has more configurations and options).</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_settings.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Settings Application</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            
            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_control_panel.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Control Panel Application</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>The Control Panel application looks like it has also been taken
            out straight from Windows XP or Windows 7.</p>

            <h3>2. Bloatware</h3>
            
            <p>Bloatware is any unwanted apps that come pre-installed with an
            operating system or program. Bloatware can slow down your computer
            and take up valuable space in your disk. Windows 10 has a ton of
            Bloatware.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_bloatware.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Windows start menu with bloatware apps and games</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>It is usually in the form of games such as Candy Crush Friends,
            Candy Crush Saga, Cooking Fever, Asphalt 8, and much more.
            Thankfully, these apps can be uninstalled with just a few
            clicks.</p>

            <h3>3. Old Accessories and Apps</h3>

            <p>Since so many businesses and people depend on Microsoft’s legacy
            applications such as MS Paint, WordPad, and more, Microsoft has
            decided to keep these legacy applications on Windows 10 and
            pre-installs them. However, I think these apps should be optional to
            install during the setup screen or in the Microsoft store since most
            users don’t use these applications.</p>

            <h3>4. Uninstallable Apps</h3>

            <p>Most apps that are pre-installed on Windows 10 are uninstallable,
            and the uninstallation process usually takes 2 or 3 clicks. However,
            some apps are uninstallable for absolutely no reason.</p>

            <p>Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant can be disabled but not
            installed. The “Your Phone” app, which is fully functional with a
            few phones is also uninstallable, and the Xbox Game Bar app is also
            uninstallable.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure why Microsoft has chosen to make these apps
            uninstallable since they do not provide any core functionality for
            Windows 10 to function.</p>

            <h3>5. Uncostomizable Browser Options</h3>

            <p>Recently, Microsoft created their new chromium-browser called
            Microsoft Edge. Although the browser is not the worst, I prefer to
            use Firefox due to its numerous extensions, features, and strong
            security. Thankfully, Windows has a feature to set your default
            browser, however, this feature is very limited.</p>

            <p>When setting your default browser as Firefox for example, all
            Windows does is open links to Firefox by default and not Edge.
            However, Windows does not open links in your default browser if you
            use the Windows Search feature, instead, it opens in Microsoft
            Edge.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/windows10_search.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Windows 10 search feature</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Windows also opens help links (usually found in the settings
            applications) in Microsoft Edge. This is quite frustrating for me as
            Microsoft Edge is not my preferred browser, and I’m not a big fan of
            using two different browsers at once.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

            <p>Windows is an overall great operating system, but there are small
            things in the operating system that grind my gears me such as their
            inconsistent design. Since Microsoft announced that they would no
            longer be releasing new versions of Windows, but instead releasing
            small updates every few months, I really do hope they commit to
            their new design system and fix the major issues the OS has.</p>
