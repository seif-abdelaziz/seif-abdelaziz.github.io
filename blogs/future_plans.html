            <h1>Future Plans for Discord Bots App</h1>
            <hr>
            <h5>January 23rd, 2021 · 6 minute read </h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Over the past couple of months, I have had many ideas about
                features I would like to add to the app, and I decided that I'm
                going to dump them into a blog post. Before I start working on these
                features, I have decided to rewrite the entire app from scratch for
                many reasons:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I know a lot more about app development now than I did back
                    in August.</li>
                <li>Many of these new features require me to change a ton of
                    things about the current app, so I figured it would be easier to
                    rewrite the app.</li>
                <li>The project is not structured very well and is quite messy.</li>
                <li>The app is not very optimized and is slow on some devices.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now that that’s out of the way, let me get into the features I’m planning for the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Translations</h3>

            <p>This feature has been suggested a thousand times already because
                the majority of the app’s users are non-English speakers, and the
                only language the app supports is English.
            </p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/future_audiences.png"
                        class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Percentage of users from top countries</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Based on the location of the majority of users, I will probably
                add Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, German, and Chinese as the first
                supported languages, and will likely add more in the future. To
                gather translators, I will likely add a form to the app for those
                who are interested in translating, I will also ask for help in the
                Discord Bots community server which has 3,000 members from all
                around the world.</p>

            <h3>Login with Discord</h3>

            <p>Currently, the app doesn’t have any sign-up/login feature, since
                it's not needed. However, as the app grows, it is not very ideal to
                store user information locally on the device, since the user’s data
                is gone if the app is deleted from the device. As a result, I
                decided that a login feature is necessary for the app.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/future_login.png"
                        class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Preview of work in progress account screen
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>The advantage of this system is that user data will no longer be
                stored on the device and, therefore cannot be lost if the app is
                deleted, and can be synced if the user has multiple devices with the
                app installed. Another advantage of this system is that users can
                now generate content instead of having to go to an external site.
                This feature enables me to add other neat features as well such as
                being able to review Discord bots and being able to publish your
                Discord bot directly from the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Light theme and Dark Theme
            </h3>

            <p>Although most apps and services have a light theme by default, I
                chose to design the Discord Bots app with a dark theme in mind since
                it most resembled Discord. However, many people prefer light theme,
                so I decided to add an option to switch between dark theme and light
                theme or use the device’s default system theme. Just like the dark
                theme, I will try to make the light theme resemble the official
                Discord app to make users familiar and at home with the UI and color
                scheme.</p>

            <div class="image-figure">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/future_dark.png"
                        class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">System-Wide Dark Mode on iOS
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3>iOS and Android designs</h3>

            <p>The default design system that comes out of the box with Flutter
                is Android’s material design system, which is currently the app’s
                default design. The problem with material design is that it does not
                resemble iOS’s design system, therefore iOS users including myself
                receive a slightly different design than they are used to. Although
                many apps on the iOS store use material design such as Google, I
                think it would be best if I made separate widgets for iOS to conform
                with its design system. Luckily, Flutter has a package filled with
                iOS widgets so it shouldn’t be too difficult to implement a
                different design for iOS.</p>

            <h3>Analytics for Bot Developers
            </h3>

            <p>All developers love analytics regarding their project; it lets
                them see how their project is doing and what needs to be improved.
                Presently, the app does not have any analytics for bot developers,
                mainly because there is no login feature to allow analytics and
                developer accounts to be stored. But with the development of the
                login with Discord feature, I hope to add an analytics screen for
                bot developers when they visit their bot.
            </p>

            <p>Analytics will include things such as impressions, page views,
                invites, votes, and more! I also plan on adding app analytics such
                as views per page and most viewed/invited bots. Hopefully, these
                analytics can give bot developers and me an idea of what users
                prefer.
            </p>

            <h3>Release Data</h3>

            <p>Recently, it has been especially hard to work on the app because
                school is very time-consuming. As a result, development has slowed
                down on the app and I have not been able to push any updates. I
                cannot promise an exact release date but I’m hoping I can finish the
                update by February or March.</p>
